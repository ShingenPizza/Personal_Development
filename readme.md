### Personal Development

This is a Factorio mod that slowly increases your skills the more you use them.

The idea was born in response to the couple of RPG-style mods, with which you
earned experience points for various things, which increased your levels, which
in turn gave you points to spend on things like increased movement speed or
reach.
I find that concept ridiculous, so I decided to make a mod of my own with a
system that better reflects how it IMO should work.

With this mod your character will slowly increase its walking speed by walking,
its crafting speed by crafting items, etc.

I will make this description better once I'm no longer tired of fighting with
this mod...

##### WARNING:
Simply disabling this mod will not remove your gained bonuses.
If you want to get rid of them, you will have to reset them to 0 using console
commands manually (be careful if you're using other mods that change them
though).
As for now there is no function that would do it automatically, sorry.

This is the first time I'm playing around with scripts running during gameplay,
and while I tried to find various combinations of cases that could break,
I'm quite sure this is not perfect, so sorry in advance for all the possible
crashes, especially in weird combinations like trying to change mod settings
after some player who died while driving a car left the game before respawning.
